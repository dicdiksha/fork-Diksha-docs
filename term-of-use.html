                Out of all the consumption clients, only the DIKSHA web portal uses cookies. DIKSHA only uses session cookies, none of the other types of cookies. DIKSHA session cookies are used to store URLs in order to better redirect users to the right pages. For example, when a User signs-in to DIKSHA from the courses page, they'll need to be redirected back to the courses page at the end of sign-in for a cleaner user experience. Session cookies are also used to store whether to use the Content Delivery Network (CDN) to pull images, plugins and other assets that are shown on the user interface. This is to enable faster loading of the pages the User interacts with. No personal information, or user preferences are stored in cookies.

                Users can clear their cookies by going to their browser settings and clearing their browsing data (by specifically checking off the option to clear cookies). Doing so, does not impact their user experience on DIKSHA as usage of DIKSHA sets the cookies again. Users can also choose to block cookies from the settings as well. Doing so, will mean that certain things on DIKSHA will not function properly. For eg., images/plugins may take a long time to load and the user will not be taken to the right pages after login.

        >
        <p>
          This Content Policy sets out the guidelines for content to be followed
          on DIKSHA. The DIKSHA Strategy and Approach Paper clearly articulates
          one of the intentions of DIKSHA - to create a common repository of open
          education resources for easy access to teachers across the country. This
          Content Policy sets out the principles and process to achieve this end.
        </p>
        <p>
          The content creation and curation process on DIKSHA is envisaged to be
          an open process with low barriers to entry. It celebrates and encourages
          participation by making it simple to create and share content on the
          platform. It avoids creating barriers to entry in the form of
          centralized review workflows and federates that process to the community
          to police itself. Institutional Users, through their Administrators,

              Out of all the consumption clients, only the DIKSHA web portal

              order to better redirect users to the right pages. For example,

              need to be redirected back to the courses page at the end of
              sign-in for a cleaner user experience. Session cookies are also

              Users can also choose to block cookies from the settings as well.
              Doing so, will mean that certain things on DIKSHA will not

        ><em>( Last updated on <b>28-04-2021</b> )</em></label
      >
      <p>
        This Content Policy sets out the guidelines for content to be followed
        on DIKSHA. The DIKSHA Strategy and Approach Paper clearly articulates
        one of the intentions of DIKSHA - to create a common repository of open
        education resources for easy access to teachers across the country. This
        Content Policy sets out the principles and process to achieve this end.
      </p>
      <p>
        The content creation and curation process on DIKSHA is envisaged to be
        an open process with low barriers to entry. It celebrates and encourages
        participation by making it simple to create and share content on the
        platform. It avoids creating barriers to entry in the form of
        centralized review workflows and federates that process to the community
        to police itself. Institutional Users, through their Administrators,
        being the custodians of DIKSHA, frame the guidelines and curation rules,
        and delegate the authority to curate to the community. This creates a
        platform that is open, has low barrier to entry, while the quality of
        content is ensured by the federated process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Set out below are some common-sense rules that all Users must comply
        with respect to Content on DIKSHA. These rules are to be taken seriously
        as Administrators are required to enforce the same strictly. Users are
        requested not to look for loopholes or ways around these guidelines and
        respect the spirit in which they have been created.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please read this Content Policy carefully, to learn more about the rules
        on appropriateness, accuracy, intellectual property rights and licensing
        that govern Content on DIKSHA.

            <li>Out of all the consumption clients, only the DIKSHA web portal uses cookies. DIKSHA only uses session
              cookies, none of the other types of cookies. DIKSHA session cookies are used to store URLs in order to
              better redirect users to the right pages. For example, when a User signs-in to DIKSHA from the courses
              page, they\'ll need to be redirected back to the courses page at the end of sign-in for a cleaner user
              experience. Session cookies are also used to store whether to use the Content Delivery Network (CDN) to
              pull images, plugins and other assets that are shown on the user interface. This is to enable faster
              loading of the pages the User interacts with. No personal information, or user preferences are stored in
              cookies.</li>
            <li>Users can clear their cookies by going to their browser settings and clearing their browsing data (by
              specifically checking off the option to clear cookies). Doing so, does not impact their user experience on
              DIKSHA as usage of DIKSHA sets the cookies again. Users can also choose to block cookies from the settings
              as well. Doing so, will mean that certain things on DIKSHA will not function properly. For eg.,
              images/plugins may take a long time to load and the user will not be taken to the right pages after login.

      <h3><strong>Content Policy of DIKSHA</strong></h3> <label class="tagLine">(<em>Last updated on <b>03-02-2021</b> )
        </em></label>
      <p>This Content Policy set out the guidelines for content to be followed on DIKSHA. The DIKSHA Strategy and
        Approach Paper clearly articulates one of the intentions of DIKSHA - to create a common repository of open
        education resources for easy access to teachers across the country. This Content Policy sets out the principles
        and process to achieve this end. </p>
      <p>The content creation and curation process on DIKSHA is envisaged to be an open process with low barriers to
        entry. It celebrates and encourages participation by making it simple to create and share content on the
        platform. It avoids creating barriers to entry in the form of centralized review workflows and federates that
        process to the community to police itself. Institutional Users, through their Administrators, being the
        custodians of DIKSHA, frame the guidelines and curation rules, and delegate the authority to curate to the
        community. This creates a platform that is open, has low barrier to entry, while the quality of content is
        ensured by the federated process.</p>
      <p>Set out below are some common-sense rules that all Users must comply with respect to Content on DIKSHA. These
        rules are to be taken seriously as Administrators are required to enforce the same strictly. Users are requested
        not to look for loopholes or ways around these guidelines and respect the spirit in which they have been
        created.</p>

        intellectual property rights and licensing that govern Content on DIKSHA. </p>

            <li>Out of all the consumption clients, only the DIKSHA web portal uses cookies. DIKSHA only uses session
              cookies, none of the other types of cookies. DIKSHA session cookies are used to store URLs in order to
              better redirect users to the right pages. For example, when a User signs-in to DIKSHA from the courses
              page, they\'ll need to be redirected back to the courses page at the end of sign-in for a cleaner user
              experience. Session cookies are also used to store whether to use the Content Delivery Network (CDN) to
              pull images, plugins and other assets that are shown on the user interface. This is to enable faster
              loading of the pages the User interacts with. No personal information, or user preferences are stored in
              cookies.</li>
            <li>Users can clear their cookies by going to their browser settings and clearing their browsing data (by
              specifically checking off the option to clear cookies). Doing so, does not impact their user experience on
              DIKSHA as usage of DIKSHA sets the cookies again. Users can also choose to block cookies from the settings
              as well. Doing so, will mean that certain things on DIKSHA will not function properly. For eg.,
              images/plugins may take a long time to load and the user will not be taken to the right pages after login.

      <h3><strong>Content Policy of DIKSHA</strong></h3> <label class="tagLine"><em>( Last updated on <b>21-12-2020</b>
          )</em></label>
      <p>This Content Policy set out the guidelines for content to be followed on DIKSHA. The DIKSHA Strategy and
        Approach Paper clearly articulates one of the intentions of DIKSHA - to create a common repository of open
        education resources for easy access to teachers across the country. This Content Policy sets out the principles
        and process to achieve this end.</p>
      <p>The content creation and curation process on DIKSHA is envisaged to be an open process with low barriers to
        entry. It celebrates and encourages participation by making it simple to create and share content on the
        platform. It avoids creating barriers to entry in the form of centralized review workflows and federates that
        process to the community to police itself. Institutional Users, through their Administrators, being the
        custodians of DIKSHA, frame the guidelines and curation rules, and delegate the authority to curate to the
        community. This creates a platform that is open, has low barrier to entry, while the quality of content is
        ensured by the federated process.</p>
      <p>Set out below are some common-sense rules that all Users must comply with respect to Content on DIKSHA. These
        rules are to be taken seriously as Administrators are required to enforce the same strictly. Users are requested
        not to look for loopholes or ways around these guidelines and respect the spirit in which they have been
        created.</p>
      <p>Please read this Content Policy carefully, to learn more about the rules on appropriateness, accuracy,
        intellectual property rights and licensing that govern Content on DIKSHA.</p>

      <h3><strong>Content Policy of DIKSHA</strong></h3> <label class="tagLine"><em>( Last updated on <b>22-10-2020</b>
          )</em></label>
      <p>This Content Policy set out the guidelines for content to be followed on DIKSHA. The DIKSHA Strategy and
        Approach Paper clearly articulates one of the intentions of DIKSHA - to create a common repository of open
        education resources for easy access to teachers across the country. This Content Policy sets out the principles
        and process to achieve this end.</p>
      <p>The content creation and curation process on DIKSHA is envisaged to be an open process with low barriers to
        entry. It celebrates and encourages participation by making it simple to create and share content on the
        platform. It avoids creating barriers to entry in the form of centralized review workflows and federates that
        process to the community to police itself. Institutional Users, through their Administrators, being the
        custodians of DIKSHA, frame the guidelines and curation rules, and delegate the authority to curate to the
        community. This creates a platform that is open, has low barrier to entry, while the quality of content is
        ensured by the federated process.</p>
      <p>Set out below are some common-sense rules that all Users must comply with respect to Content on DIKSHA. These
        rules are to be taken seriously as Administrators are required to enforce the same strictly. Users are requested
        not to look for loopholes or ways around these guidelines and respect the spirit in which they have been
        created.</p>
      <p>Please read this Content Policy carefully, to learn more about the rules on appropriateness, accuracy,
        intellectual property rights and licensing that govern Content on DIKSHA.</p>

          )</em></label>
      <p>This Content Policy set out the guidelines for content to be followed on DIKSHA. The DIKSHA Strategy and
        Approach Paper clearly articulates one of the intentions of DIKSHA - to create a common repository of open
        education resources for easy access to teachers across the country. This Content Policy sets out the principles
        and process to achieve this end.</p>
      <p>The content creation and curation process on DIKSHA is envisaged to be an open process with low barriers to
        entry. It celebrates and encourages participation by making it simple to create and share content on the
        platform. It avoids creating barriers to entry in the form of centralized review workflows and federates that
        process to the community to police itself. Institutional Users, through their Administrators, being the
        custodians of DIKSHA, frame the guidelines and curation rules, and delegate the authority to curate to the
        community. This creates a platform that is open, has low barrier to entry, while the quality of content is
        ensured by the federated process.</p>
      <p>Set out below are some common-sense rules that all Users must comply with respect to Content on DIKSHA. These
        rules are to be taken seriously as Administrators are required to enforce the same strictly. Users are requested
        not to look for loopholes or ways around these guidelines and respect the spirit in which they have been
        created.</p>
      <p>Please read this Content Policy carefully, to learn more about the rules on appropriateness, accuracy,
        intellectual property rights and licensing that govern Content on DIKSHA.</p>

      <h3><strong>Content Policy of DIKSHA</strong></h3> <label class="tagLine"><em>( Last updated on <b>23-06-2020</b>
          )</em></label>
      <p>This Content Policy set out the guidelines for content to be followed on DIKSHA. The DIKSHA Strategy and
        Approach Paper clearly articulates one of the intentions of DIKSHA - to create a common repository of open
        education resources for easy access to teachers across the country. This Content Policy sets out the principles
        and process to achieve this end.</p>
      <p>The content creation and curation process on DIKSHA is envisaged to be an open process with low barriers to
        entry. It celebrates and encourages participation by making it simple to create and share content on the
        platform. It avoids creating barriers to entry in the form of centralized review workflows and federates that
        process to the community to police itself. Institutional Users, through their Administrators, being the
        custodians of DIKSHA, frame the guidelines and curation rules, and delegate the authority to curate to the
        community. This creates a platform that is open, has low barrier to entry, while the quality of content is
        ensured by the federated process.</p>
      <p>Set out below are some common-sense rules that all Users must comply with respect to Content on DIKSHA. These
        rules are to be taken seriously as Administrators are required to enforce the same strictly. Users are requested
        not to look for loopholes or ways around these guidelines and respect the spirit in which they have been
        created.</p>

        intellectual property rights and licensing that govern Content on DIKSHA.</p>

      <h3>Content Policy of DIKSHA</h3><label class="tagLine"><i>( Last updated on <b>21-05-2020</b> )</i></label>
      <p>This Content Policy set out the guidelines for content to be followed on DIKSHA. The DIKSHAStrategy and
        Approach Paper clearly articulates one of the intentions of DIKSHA - to create acommon repository of open

        and process to achieve this end. </p>
      <p>The content creation and curation process on DIKSHA is envisaged to be an open process with lowbarriers to
        entry. It celebrates and encourages participation by making it simple to create andshare content on the
        platform. It avoids creating barriers to entry in the form of centralizedreview workflows and federates that
        process to the community to police itself. InstitutionalUsers, through their Administrators, being the
        custodians of DIKSHA, frame the guidelines andcuration rules, and delegate the authority to curate to the
        community. This creates a platformthat is open, has low barrier to entry, while the quality of content is
        ensured by the federatedprocess.</p>
      <p>Set out below are some common-sense rules that all Users must comply with respect to Content onDIKSHA. These
        rules are to be taken seriously as Administrators are required to enforce the samestrictly. Users are requested
        not to look for loopholes or ways around these guidelines andrespect the spirit in which they have been created.
